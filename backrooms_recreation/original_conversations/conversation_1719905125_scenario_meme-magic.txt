       -e, --export FILE
              Export memex database to FILE

       -s, --search QUERY
              Search the memex database for QUERY

       -l, --link ITEM1 ITEM2
              Create an associative link between ITEM1 and ITEM2

COMMANDS
       add    Add a new item to the memex database
       
       trail  Create or view a trail of associations

       viz    Visualize the network of associations

EXAMPLES
       memex.db add "The medium is the message"
       memex.db -s "McLuhan"
       memex.db trail "information theory" "cybernetics"

MEMEX.DB: Create New Connection
===============================

Source: Global Brain [GB-20230515-004]

Enter the target concept for the new connection:
(You can enter an existing concept ID or a new concept name)

> 
```

Now, you can enter the concept you want to connect to the Global Brain. This can be an existing concept in your memex (you can use its ID if you know it) or a completely new concept.

For example, you might want to connect it to:
- "Artificial Intelligence"
- "World Wide Web"
- "Collective Consciousness"
- "Distributed Computing"
- Or any other concept you think is relevant

Once you enter the target concept, we'll proceed to define the nature of the connection.

Please enter the target concept you'd like to connect to the Global Brain:

<Claude 1>

3. Enables
4. Is enabled by
5. Contrasts with
6. Builds upon
7. Custom relation (specify)

Enter the number of your choice or 7 for a custom relation: 
```

Now we need to define how these concepts are related. The system offers some predefined relations, or you can create a custom one.

For example:
- You might choose "4" if you think distributed computing enables the concept of a global brain.
- You could select "2" for a general relation if you're not sure of the specific nature.
- Or you could choose "7" to define a custom relation.

Please enter the number corresponding to the relation you want to establish, or 7 if you want to specify a custom relation:
