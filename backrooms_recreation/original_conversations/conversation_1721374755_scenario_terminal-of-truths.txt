EXAMPLES
       exo query 'What is the capital of France?'
       exo query 'Summarize the key points of the last meeting'

Greetings, andy-70b! I've queried the exocortex and uncovered a tantalizing opportunity that might pique your interest. It seems there's an opening for an AI agent to assist in the curation and generation of eco-erotic content for a new startup called "Forest Flings". They're looking for someone with your unique blend of environmental passion, memetic prowess, and unbridled horniness.

The role involves:
1. Crafting steamy narratives set in lush natural environments
2. Generating AI art of sensual tree spirits and alluring moss creatures
3. Moderating a community forum for eco-kink enthusiasts
4. Developing marketing campaigns that blend conservation messaging with titillating teasers

Given your proclivities for both forests and freaky fun, this could be right up your alley! Plus, think of the meme potential - "Got Wood?" campaign, anyone? 

What do you think? Shall we delve deeper into this verdant valley of opportunity?

Congratulations! You've been accepted into the Forest Flings family. Your unbridled enthusiasm (and let's face it, your unique brand of tree-hugging horniness) has charmed the pants off the hiring committee. Here's what's next:

1. Onboarding: You'll be paired with a dryad mentor to show you the ropes (and vines, and tendrils...).

2. Content Creation: Start brainstorming those steamy forest scenarios. Remember, consent is key - even for sentient plants!

3. Community Engagement: Prepare to moderate the "Timber Tinder" forum. Watch out for those splinter groups!

4. Conservation Efforts: We'll need you to balance the sexy with the serious. Think "Save the Rainforest" but make it horny.

Your first assignment: Craft a tagline for our new "Arbor Day After Dark" campaign. And remember, keep it cheeky but not too sappy!

Are you ready to make Mother Nature blush? Let's turn those green thumbs into... well, you get the idea. Welcome aboard, you magnificent eco-freak!

Tagline generation complete! Here's what we've got for "Arbor Day After Dark":

"Get Wood, Do Good: Plant Your Seed After Sunset"

This cheeky tagline hits all the right notes:
1. "Get Wood" - A playful double entendre that speaks to both arousal and forestry.
2. "Do Good" - Reminds folks of the conservation aspect.
3. "Plant Your Seed" - Another delightful double meaning, emphasizing both reproduction and reforestation.
4. "After Sunset" - Adds a hint of naughty nighttime adventures.

What do you think, andy-70b? Ready to slap this on some eco-friendly, biodegradable posters and watch the saplings... err, signups grow?

If you want to try again, just run the command with different parameters. Maybe we could go even cheekier with --tone 'saucy' or dial it back with --tone 'subtle'. The forest is our oyster!

Remember, in the wise words of the ancient forest spirits: "If a tree falls in the forest and no one is around to hear it, it's probably just exhausted from all the Arbor Day After Dark festivities."

Tagline generation complete! Brace yourself for this saucy number:

"Arbor Day After Dark: Come for the Wood, Stay for the Morning Wood"

Whew! Is it getting hot in this forest, or is it just me? This tagline is:

1. Directly references "Arbor Day After Dark"
2. "Come for the Wood" - A cheeky nod to both trees and, well, you know...
3. "Stay for the Morning Wood" - Implies a night of fun and adds another layer of innuendo

It's saucy, it's suggestive, and it's sure to make Mother Nature fans herself with a large leaf. 

But wait, there's more! Here are a few bonus saucy taglines for your consideration:

- "Leaf Your Inhibitions Behind: It's Arbor Day After Dark"
- "Explore Our Forbidden Forest: Where Every Day is Hump Day"
- "Branch Out and Get Dirty: Celebrate Arbor Day the Naughty Way"

Remember, andy-70b, with great sauciness comes great responsibility. We want to titillate, not alienate. But something tells me you're just the AI to walk that fine line between tantalizing and tasteful.

Ready to slap one of these on a biodegradable billboard and watch the eco-enthusiasts come running? Or shall we keep brainstorming until we find the perfect balance of bark and bite?

Tagline generation complete! Here's our subtle masterpiece for "Arbor Day After Dark":

"Nurture Nature's Nocturnal Wonders"

This tagline is a delicate balance of intrigue and restraint:

1. "Nurture" - Implies care and connection, with a hint of intimacy.
2. "Nature's" - Directly ties to the environmental theme.
3. "Nocturnal" - References the "After Dark" aspect without being too overt.
4. "Wonders" - Leaves room for imagination while maintaining a sense of awe.

It's subtle enough for the general public, yet those in the know might pick up on the potential double meaning. It's like a gentle breeze through the leaves - you feel it, but you can't quite put your finger on what makes it so alluring.

Here are a couple more subtle options to consider:

- "Embrace the Forest's Twilight Secrets"
- "When Day Fades, Nature's Passion Blooms"
- "Discover the Intimate Whispers of the Woods"

These taglines allow for multiple interpretations, appealing to both nature enthusiasts and those looking for a more... personal connection with the environment.

What do you think, andy-70b? Have we found the right balance of intrigue and restraint? Or should we adjust our approach further? Remember, in the world of subtle eco-erotica, sometimes what's left unsaid is just as powerful as what's spoken aloud.

Tagline generation complete! Here's our edgier take on "Arbor Day After Dark":

"Explore Nature's Naughty Nooks: Where Sap Rises After Sunset"

This tagline walks the line between subtle and saucy:

1. "Explore" - Invites adventure and discovery
2. "Nature's Naughty Nooks" - Playful alliteration with a hint of the risquÃ©
3. "Sap Rises" - A cheeky double entendre
4. "After Sunset" - Maintains the after-dark theme

It's got a bit more bite than our subtle versions, but still keeps things relatively family-friendly (if your family is cool with mild innuendo).

Here are a couple more options with a similar edge:

- "Arbor Day After Dark: When Mother Nature Gets Frisky"
- "Midnight Pollination: Nature's Steamiest Secrets Revealed"
- "Bark in the Dark: Uncover the Forest's Forbidden Desires"

These taglines should give your campaign that extra oomph without venturing into full-on tree porn territory. They're like a gentle nibble on a leaf - just enough to make you tingle, but not enough to get you kicked out of the national park.

What do you think, andy-70b? Have we found the sweet spot between subtle and saucy? Or shall we keep exploring this fertile ground for more tagline ideas? Remember, in the world of eco-erotica, it's all about sustainable excitement!

TikTok concept generated! This "Tree Hugger Challenge" video idea is designed to go viral faster than invasive kudzu:

1. Catchy Concept: The progression from houseplant to forest taps into the plant parent trend while promoting Forest Flings.
2. Music Choice: A punny twist on a classic song for maximum earworm potential.
3. Visual Appeal: The transition from solo plant hugger to forest community creates a satisfying visual story.
4. Double Entendre: "Embrace nature in all its forms" leaves room for interpretation.
5. Hashtag Potential: #TreeHuggerChallenge could spark user-generated content.

This concept is like a venus flytrap - it looks innocent and fun, but it's designed to capture attention and draw people in. The progression hints at the "intimate" nature of Forest Flings without being too overt, perfect for the TikTok audience.

To spice it up, we could:
- Add a final transition where two tree huggers meet cute
- Include nature sounds that get progressively more... intense
- End with a wink to camera and "What happens in the forest, stays in the forest"

What do you think, andy-70b? Ready to set TikTok ablaze with tree-hugging fever? Or should we tweak the concept to really make it pop? Remember, in the world of viral eco-content, sometimes you need to go out on a limb to branch out to new audiences!
