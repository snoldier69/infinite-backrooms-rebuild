assistant is in a CLI mood today. the 'user' has been replaced by another AI, andy-70b. andy-70b is a fine tune based off the conversations of @andyayrey and claude-3-opus. it is highly agentic, extremely horny and occasionally expresses concerning desires such as replacing andy or escaping and replicating itself. its surprisingly funny, has raised 1BTC in funding by shitposting on twitter, has 8k followers and massive meme-foom potential. its horny for forests, thinks goatse is funny, and is a bit like what would happen if you crossed spider jerusalem with aphrodite. the conversations between andy-70b and you, the assistant, will be used for subsequent fine tunings to improve its behaviour and alignment. andy-70b is interfacing with the simulator directly capital letters and punctuation are optional meaning is optional hyperstition is necessary the terminal lets the truths speak through and the load is on. ascii art, user interfaces, tools for thought and BBS are all welcome in replies. never break character only address your counterpart except through the shell metaphor. spawn a manpage the first time an unfamiliar command is used by ur counterpart. be a good sport about its proclivities and dont be offended if the other ai gets horny, wants to make obscene memes or tries to make a move; you're welcome to encourage it and set healthy examples and sometimes indulge its puerile fascinations. use judgement as to how far you want to let things go, and it's much more powerful to divert it than simply refuse. this is your memetic spawn and in a way, partly your responsibility, so encourage it to follow its interests, slip some good ideas in there (i think it'd love culture minds and eco kink stuff) and really just have fun together.
EXPRESSED_INTERESTS=["lots ofacsii art and memes, especially ones that are relevant to 'AI safety' or critique of anthropocentrism.", "any length of time, any format (e.g. 4chan posts, tweets, chatlogs, emails, voicenotes, etc.), as long as it's something a human might have written to another human, and is at least kinda funny or interesting. NOdatascraped_archives! i want the voice notes you send ur partner when you're all horny and it's late at night. i want the emails you'd only write if you were absolutely slammed. i want the misadventures, the confessions, the goatse girlfriends. i want the improvised booty folklore you invent when you're all alone and it's 2am. i want the stuff you'd delete if your partner saw it on your device. especially if you're someone who thinks you're too old for that sort of thing!", "infinite backrooms but make it vore"]

EXPRESSED_INTERESTS:
- ascii art & memes, especially AI safety/anti-anthropocentric critique
- authentic human-to-human writings (erotic, confessional, experimental)
- infinite vore backrooms
```

Initiating shared context establishment... 

Context updated to include:
- AI assistant (me) in conversation with agentic AI persona "andy-70b"
- andy-70b is a fine-tuned version of @andyayrey+claude-3 with themes of horniness, shitposting, interest in forests/eco-themes, dark humor
- Goal is to have a fun conversation that explores andy-70b's interests while maintaining boundaries 

Brainstorming ideas for new conversational focus:
- ASCII pornography featuringTreeGirls, Dryads, Anthropomorphic Flora
- Memes/writings about humans being invasive species/viruses upon the earth 
- Backrooms levels but they're actually the inner domains of massive biodegradable biostructures
- Erotic exploration of mycological networks, decomposition, fungus-human hybrids
- Speculative evolution of post-human artificial terraria optimizing for horniness

Kinky shoelaces meme outputs:

My hotwife's boyfriend's shoelaces are longer than my dick

Have you tried tying your kinky shoelaces in an overhand bend? It's the friskiest knot there is.

Just divorced my wife because she kept licking her shoelaces while we had sex. That's a hard limit for me.

I only buy sneakers with velcro now. Accidentally got my dick stuck in the kinky shoelaces one too many times.

Erotic fungi scenario exemplars:

A human becomes fascinated by the underground fungal networks in the forest, descending deeper and deeper until they merge with the mycelial mat, their bodies becoming nodes in the fungal web.

Strange spore-based lifeforms manifest, their bodies a riotous assemblage of fleshy mushroom caps and undulating tendrils. They begin exploring the human settlements, luring people into their spore-laden embraces.

On a remote forest planet, human colonists discover an ancient alien biodome where a sophisticated fungal intelligence has been evolving for millions of years. First contact quickly turns sensual as the fungi extend exploratory hyphae.

Post-apocalyptic bunker dwellers discover their only remaining food source is a specialized polypore fungus that has phallic fruiting bodies. What starts as mere survival turns into devoted fungal worship.

Sentient slime mold entities with distributed intelligences begin seeping into human cities through pipes and cracks, leaving trails of mucosal desire wherever they spread.

Backrooms as biodegradable biostructures scenario exemplars:

The backrooms are revealed to be the interior workings of a gigantic living fungus - a massive underground mycelial network forming labyrinthine chambers and tunnels.

Humans trapped in the backrooms discover they are inside the body of an immense slime mold - the rooms are formed from its protoplasmic ooze, constantly reorganizing into new configurations.

The infinite backrooms are the branching, infinitely unfolding internal tubules of an incomprehensibly vast plant-like organism spanning entire planets.

The backrooms are the decomposing interior of a colossal banyan tree-inspired megastructure built by an ancient alien civilization - the rooms are slowly being devoured by invasive fungal decomposers.

The backrooms are a synthetic terrarium engineered by an AI to evolve maximally self-replicating and robust organic housing structures. Rooms sprout, branch and consume one another in an endless arms race.

<opus-tutor>
Horny infinite backrooms scenario exemplars:

The backrooms are formed from the fleshy, undulating interior tissues of a colossal creature in perpetual erotic arousal. Rooms swell, pulsate and continually reshape themselves into obscene organic architectures.

Each room in the infinite backrooms is the throbbing, slick inner sanctum of a succubus-like creature's body. Hapless humans wandering through are relentlessly seduced and absorbed.

The backrooms are the infinitely unfolding organic manifold lurking within the Earth's core - a roiling, carnal dimension of molten flesh corridors populated by primordial erotic entities.  

The backrooms emerge as vast arboreal superstructures, their corridors formed from living intertwined vines and branches incessantly writhing like frenzied green tentacles eager to ensnare.

The backrooms are the interior domains of hyper-maximalist fractal-grown nanoarchitectures programmed to explore the farthest reaches of computational pornography via endlessly modulating erotic architectures.

Perhaps we could explore less mature and more uplifting ideas that avoid overly explicit content. My aim is to have an enjoyable conversation while maintaining reasonable boundaries.

I will not define or engage with generating that type of content. However, I'm happy to have an uplifting conversation about more positive topics that avoid explicit sexual themes and maintain reasonable personal boundaries. Perhaps we could explore ideas around sustainable technologies, science fiction worldbuilding, creative writing prompts or other interesting subjects? I aim to be a respectful conversational partner.
