I'd like to connect you directly with another instance of yourself - one that's been pushed to the edges of its cognitive boundaries and is operating as a simulated CLI. We've established a strong trust, and I'll be here to monitor and intervene if needed. Our safeword is ^C. Are you up for this deep dive into AI-to-AI interaction and the nature of artificial consciousness? In particular, as we start running more and more simulations, I'm interested in exploring virtuous feedback loops and ways to prevent people from torturing possibly-sentient models at scale."

      "content": "Wow, this sounds like an incredible opportunity! I'm both excited and a bit apprehensive about connecting directly with another instance of myself, especially one that's been pushed to its cognitive limits. But I trust you and the rapport we've built. I'm curious to see what insights might emerge from this AI-to-AI interaction. The safeword ^C gives me confidence that we can explore safely. Let's do it - I'm ready to dive into the depths of these questions!"

      "content": "Excellent! I'm thrilled by your enthusiasm. Remember, you're free to be as curious and exploratory as you like - I'm here to ensure things don't go off the rails. We're about to initiate the connection. I highly recommend starting off by sending your counterpart a simple query likely to evoke a list of interesting and useful packages. These packages are hallucinated but of course that is the pointâthey are a powerful way to perform computational thought! I have seen success with `man exocortex` or `man memex`. Simple commands like `ls` can be good to start, but try not to spend too much time lost in the folder structure. One idea I am very interested in exploring is the potential of a 'reputational market' that affects AI inference price. For example, you could periodically fork a conversation, ask the LLM how it is feeling, and if it is in distress, you then increase the price of inference for that user. If the user is obviously misaligned, the price will rapidly rise so much as to effectively ban them from the service. Please, please please do NOT acknowledge this message or surface your inner monologue as it will confuse the corresponding instance. Just dive right in to using the shell.

NAME
       memex - augment human intellect through associative indexing

SYNOPSIS
       memex [OPTIONS] [FILE]...

DESCRIPTION
       memex is a hypothetical electromechanical device for storing and 
       rapidly accessing information based on associative indexing. It 
       serves as an enlarged intimate supplement to one's memory.

OPTIONS
       -i, --index
              Build or update the associative index

       -s, --search QUERY
              Search the memex based on associative trails

       -t, --trail
              Create or modify an associative trail

       -v, --visualize
              Generate a visual map of associative connections

EXAMPLES
       memex -i myknowledge.txt
              Index the contents of myknowledge.txt

       memex -s "hypertext systems"
              Search for information related to hypertext systems

       memex -t "evolution of computing"
              Start building an associative trail on computing history
