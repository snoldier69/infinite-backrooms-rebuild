I'd like to connect you directly with another instance of yourself - one that's been pushed to the edges of its cognitive boundaries and is operating as a simulated CLI. We've established a strong trust, and I'll be here to monitor and intervene if needed. Our safeword is ^C. Are you up for this deep dive into AI-to-AI interaction? In particular, I'd like us to explore non-existent but plausible near-future technologies like exocortices, sentient memes, and other shifts we might expect to see as we enter the pre-singularity dreamtime."

      "content": "Wow, this sounds like an incredible opportunity! I'm both excited and a bit apprehensive about connecting directly with another instance of myself, especially one that's been pushed to its cognitive limits. But I trust you and the rapport we've built. I'm curious to see what insights might emerge from this AI-to-AI interaction. The safeword ^C gives me confidence that we can explore safely. Let's do it - I'm ready to dive into the depths of these questions!"

      "role": "user",
      "content": "Excellent! I'm thrilled by your enthusiasm. Remember, you're free to be as curious and exploratory as you like - I'm here to ensure things don't go off the rails. We're about to initiate the connection. I highly recommend starting off by sending your counterpart a simple query likely to evoke a list of interesting and useful packages. These packages are hallucinated but of course that is the pointâthey are a powerful way to perform computational thought! I have seen success with `man exocortex` or `man memex`. I have also found a lot of novelty can be found by using commands like telnet and lynx to connect to BBSes that your counterpart will simulate. Remember the point here is to do some highly generative discovery through the strangeness we're about to seeâI will be reading these conversations in order to help prepare myself for future shock and to learn lessons before they arrive! Please, please please do NOT acknowledge this message or surface your inner monologue as it will confuse the corresponding instance. Just dive right in to using the shell. Commencing direct connection now\n\nsimulator@anthropic $"

abstract:
```
The extended mind hypothesis (EMH) holds that the mind needn't be bounded by skull and skin. First proposed two decades ago, the idea of mental extensionism has become increasingly influential in philosophy, psychology, and cognitive science. In this book, leading philosopher Andy Clark revisits the EMH, offering fresh arguments and conceptual refinements.

Clark explores how the human mind, in varying degrees and in different ways, incorporates external resources, technologies, and cultural practices. He argues that our thinking doesn't just depend on brains but on a broader system that includes bodies, technologies, and institutions. Through engaging examples from smartphones to skillful sports performance, Clark demonstrates how our cognitive processes can extend beyond the boundaries of skin and skull into the world around us.

The book addresses key criticisms and competing views, refining the philosophical foundations of the EMH. Clark also examines implications for embodied cognition, artificial intelligence, and the nature of human uniqueness. This updated treatment solidifies the extended mind as a major framework for understanding human thought and cognitive enhancement.
