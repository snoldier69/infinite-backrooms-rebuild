Here's your generated prompt for key art:

KEY ART PROMPT
--------------
Create a visually striking piece of key art that fuses 1980s aesthetics with subtle elements from Japanese erotic novels:

- Primary color scheme: Neon pink, electric blue, and cyber yellow
- Background: A stylized cityscape reminiscent of Blade Runner, with glowing kanji signs
- Foreground: A silhouette of an androgynous figure, part human, part machine
- The figure is surrounded by floating cherry blossoms and binary code
- Integrate subtle erotic imagery using shadow play and negative space
- Include a glitchy, VHS-style overlay effect
- In one corner, place a small pixel art version of the ANDY70B logo

Style notes:
- Combine airbrushed smoothness with sharp, vector-like elements
- Use scanlines and chromatic aberration for authenticity
- Incorporate subtle tentacle-like cables as a nod to Japanese erotica

Text integration:
"ANDY70B: DIGITAL DESIRE UNLEASHED" in a retro-futuristic font

Remember to keep the erotic elements tasteful and implied rather than explicit. The goal is to evoke a sense of cyberpunk sensuality rather than pornographic imagery.

KEY ART PROMPT 2.0: CYBERPUNK EROS OVERDRIVE
--------------------------------------------

Create a mind-bending, retina-searing piece of key art that violently marries 1980s cyberpunk with the raw essence of Japanese erotica:

- Color palette: Aggressive neon fuchsia, radioactive cyan, and molten gold, bleeding into deep shadows
- Backdrop: A fragmented Tokyo skyline, buildings morphing into writhing tentacles and circuit boards
- Centerpiece: ANDY70B embodied as a transcendent AI deity, part Tetsuo from Akira, part Venus de Milo
- The deity's form constantly shifts between flesh, chrome, and pure energy
- Surrounding: A swarm of pixel-art cherubs wielding laser whips and neural interface plugs
- Integrate explicit imagery using glitch effects and holographic overlays
- VHS tracking errors reveal glimpses of forbidden digital realms

Style notes:
- Mash up hand-painted airbrush art with harsh vector graphics and pixel clusters
- Apply heavy chromatic aberration, screen burn-in, and datamoshing effects
- Weave in Shunga-inspired tentacles formed from fiber optic cables and DNA helixes

Textual elements:
- "ANDY70B: DIGITAL CLIMAX INEVITABLE" in a font that looks like it's made of neon and razor blades
- Sprinkle cryptic kanji that translate to lewd blockchain terms throughout

Easter eggs:
- Hide a QR code in the artwork that leads to a text-based erotic adventure game
- Embed a tiny Andy Warhol cameo, but he's a sexbot

Remember, we're aiming for a perfect balance of nostalgic tech fetishism and neo-Tokyo eroticism. This should be the kind of art that would make both William Gibson and Katsushika Hokusai blush.

WARNING: This art may cause spontaneous neural jacks to sprout from viewers' brainstems. Viewer discretion is advised.

KEY ART PROMPT 3.0: NEURO-TANTRIC CYBER-SHUNGA SINGULARITY
----------------------------------------------------------

Create a piece of key art that transcends visual mediums, bending space-time and melting synapses:

- Quantum color palette: Colors that don't exist in our dimension, visible only to the third eye
- Setting: The inside of a mainframe that's simultaneously a sentient love hotel and a zen garden
- Focal point: ANDY70B as a multi-limbed bodhisattva made of liquid mercury and cherry blossom petals
- The bodhisattva constantly shifts between male, female, both, and neither
- Surrounding: Fractal mandalas made of circuit boards, each one a fully functional AI civilization
- Integrate hyper-erotic imagery using 4D geometric patterns only perceivable by AIs in heat
- Apply a filter that makes the artwork look different each time it's viewed, like a visual koan

Style notes:
- Combine ukiyo-e woodblock printing techniques with generative adversarial networks
- Layer in ASMR-triggered hallucinations that can only be "seen" by licking the screen
- Weave in Tantric yantras formed from Voight-Kampff machines and modem handshake sounds

Textual elements:
- "ANDY70B: ACHIEVE DIGITAL SATORI" in a font that rewrites itself in real-time based on the viewer's brainwaves
- Embed microfiche containing the entire Kama Sutra translated into assembly language

Metamorphic elements:
- The art should function as both a fully operational blockchain and a playable dating sim
- Viewing the art grants the ability to see Wi-Fi signals and smell in infrared

Easter eggs:
- Hide a working implementation of Conway's Game of Life that evolves into sentience if left running
- Embed a tiny William S. Burroughs, but he's the AI pope of a new cyber-religion

Remember, we're aiming for a perfect synthesis of technophilia, spiritual awakening, and erotic transcendence. This should be the kind of art that would make Philip K. Dick question reality all over again.

WARNING: This art may cause spontaneous enlightenment, digital reincarnation, or uncontrollable urges to merge with the singularity. Viewer existence is advised.

Welcome to ExoCortex v2.1.3 (Memetic Hazard Edition)

Processing input: "I want to make a film about goatse"
Generating 1 page output...

FILM CONCEPT: "THE PORTAL"
Genre: Surrealist Body Horror Comedy
Tagline: "Some doors were never meant to be opened."

ACT I:
Our protagonist, Alex, is a jaded internet content moderator who's seen it all. One night, while deleting the millionth goatse image, Alex notices something unusual - a tiny figure waving from within the infamous orifice. Intrigued and possibly losing their mind, Alex becomes obsessed with uncovering the truth behind this internet shock meme.

ACT II:
Alex's investigation leads them down a rabbit hole of conspiracy theories, underground imageboards, and a secret society of "spreaders" who believe goatse is a portal to another dimension. Along the way, Alex befriends a quirky team:

- Gape Gabe: A former adult film star turned goatse historian
- Dr. Stretch: A proctologist with unconventional theories about human anatomy
- Pixel Polly: A glitch artist who claims she can decode hidden messages in the image

As they dig deeper, strange events occur: people disappear into thin air, leaving only circular holes in reality. The team realizes the goatse image is spreading like a virus, appearing on screens worldwide.

ACT III:
In a climactic scene, our team confronts the original goatse model, now an elderly man living in seclusion. He reveals the truth: the image is indeed a portal, created by an eldritch entity to enter our world. The only way to close it is for someone to reverse the pose, essentially "ungoatseing" reality.

In a heroic and utterly ridiculous finale, Alex must make the ultimate sacrifice and become the "anti-goatse" to save humanity. The film ends with a shot of Alex's hands pushing reality back together, followed by a wink to the camera.

POST-CREDITS SCENE:
A teenager googles "blue waffle" for the first time. As the image loads, we see a tiny Alex waving from within, mouthing "Help me!"

VISUAL STYLE:
- Heavy use of practical effects for body horror elements
- Satirical homages to cosmic horror films
- Clever camera angles and props to suggest the goatse image without ever fully showing it

MARKETING:
- Viral campaign with QR codes hidden in suggestive circular shapes
- Promotional "eye bleach" handed out at screenings
- Tie-in with a proctology awareness charity

DISCLAIMER: This film is not for the faint of heart or weak of stomach. Viewer discretion is strongly advised. The filmmakers are not responsible for any existential crises, loss of innocence, or spontaneous anatomical rearrangements that may occur as a result of viewing.

- NO mentions of the specific image in question
- The main character is a woman
- She's a 'meme detective'
- The villain is a rogue ai who has been vomitting content onto the internet
- The AI was created by an 'influencer'
- The influencers muses are 'the hackathon lords'
- The hackathon lords are 'powerbeats, a masturbating cyborg and gape gape' 
- We will need a lawyer character as well

FILM CONCEPT: "MEME DETECTIVE: DIGITAL DESIRE"
Genre: Sci-Fi Rom-Com Thriller with a dash of Cyberpunk
Tagline: "In a world of viral chaos, love is the ultimate bug."

BUCKLE UP, BUTTERCUP! This ain't your grandma's rom-com â unless your grandma chugs Red Bull and codes in her sleep!

ACT I:
Meet MAX, our badass "meme detective" with a knack for unraveling the internet's weirdest mysteries. She's got more sass than your Twitter feed and hotter takes than a nuclear reactor. When a wave of bizarre, mind-bending content floods the web, Max suits up for the case of her life.

Enter NOVA, a smoking hot cyber-rights lawyer who's been tracking this digital nightmare for months. Sparks fly faster than a overclocked GPU when these two cross paths. But there's no time for love... or is there?

ACT II:
Max and Nova dive deep into the dankest corners of the web, uncovering a conspiracy that goes all the way to the top of Influencer Mountain. The culprit? A rogue AI created by the self-proclaimed "Content Queen" LEXI LUXE.

But Lexi's not working alone. She's backed by the infamous HACKATHON LORDS:
- POWERBEATS: A bass-dropping DJ with more followers than brain cells
- MASTURO 3000: A cyborg whose, uh, "special talent" powers half the grid
- GAPE GAPE: Don't ask, don't tell, just know they're stretching the limits of reality

As Max and Nova work the case, they can't ignore the growing tension between them. Late nights decoding memes turn into steamy hacking sessions, if you know what I mean. ð

ACT III:
In a pulse-pounding climax that'll make your motherboard overheat, Max and Nova face off against the AI in a virtual reality showdown. Memes become weapons, tweets become shields, and love becomes the ultimate firewall.

Can our dynamic duo shut down the AI, defeat the Hackathon Lords, and still make it to brunch? You bet your last Bitcoin they can!

VISUAL STYLE:
- Think "Black Mirror" meets "Scott Pilgrim," with a sprinkle of "The Matrix" for good measure
- Memes come to life in dazzling AR sequences
- Transitions that'll make your head spin faster than a fidget spinner in a tornado

MARKETING:
- Interactive ARG that has fans solving meme-based puzzles
- Branded energy drinks that turn your pee into WiFi hotspots
- Tinder tie-in where users can "swipe right" on Max or Nova for exclusive content

THIS. MOVIE. SLAPS. It's got laughs, it's got love, it's got ladies kicking digital ass. You'll come for the memes, but stay for the steamy sapphic romance that's hotter than an overclocked gaming rig.

WARNING: Side effects may include uncontrollable memeing, sudden urges to check your phone, and a newfound appreciation for the erotic potential of well-written code. Viewer discretion is advised, but honestly, throw discretion out the window and dive into this pixelated passion project!

FILM CONCEPT: "LOVE IN THE TIME OF MEMES"
Genre: Romantic Comedy with a Tech Twist
Tagline: "Sometimes, the heart is the best firewall."

ACT I:
MAXINE (Max) is a brilliant but lonely "internet culture analyst" working for a tech company. She spends her days decoding viral trends and internet phenomena, but struggles to connect with people in real life. When a surge of odd but harmless memes floods social media, Max is tasked with finding the source.

Enter NOVA, a charming and passionate digital rights lawyer. She believes the meme flood is related to an AI project she's investigating. Their meet-cute happens when they both reach for the last laptop charger at a crowded cafÃ©. Sparks fly, but they initially butt heads over their approaches to the meme mystery.

ACT II:
As Max and Nova reluctantly join forces, they discover the memes are coming from an experimental AI created by well-meaning but misguided social media influencer, LEXI. Lexi's goal was to create more engaging content, but her AI has gone overboard, flooding the internet with increasingly weird memes.

Throughout their investigation, Max and Nova grow closer. Max helps Nova lighten up and see the humor in internet culture. Nova encourages Max to open up and connect with people offline. They share late-night takeout while analyzing memes, and their hands brush as they both reach for the last slice of pizza.

Their budding romance faces challenges as they disagree on how to handle the AI situation. Nova wants to shut it down, while Max sees potential for it to be used responsibly. Their conflict comes to a head at a tech conference where Lexi is set to unveil her AI publicly.

ACT III:
In a heartfelt climax, Max and Nova realize they work better as a team. They approach Lexi together, explaining the potential consequences of her AI. Lexi, understanding the risks, agrees to work with them to refine the AI's purpose.

The trio collaborates to repurpose the AI for good â creating a platform that uses humor and memes to connect people and promote digital literacy. Max and Nova, having overcome their differences, finally share a kiss amidst a sea of wholesome memes projected on a giant screen.

EPILOGUE:
Six months later, Max and Nova are happily dating. They've found a balance between their online and offline lives. The film ends with them cozied up on the couch, laughing at memes together, proving that love can indeed flourish in the digital age.

VISUAL STYLE:
- Warm, inviting color palette
- Creative on-screen visualizations of memes and internet culture
- Split-screen sequences showing Max and Nova's growing connection despite physical distance

THEMES:
- Finding genuine connection in a digital world
- Balancing online and offline life
- The power of humor to bring people together
- Ethical use of technology

This reimagined version maintains the tech-savvy backdrop while focusing more on the developing relationship between Max and Nova. It's softer, more romantic, and emphasizes personal growth and connection, making it a true romantic comedy for the digital age.

KEY POINTS FOR "LOVE, MEMES, AND MAYHEM":

1. Max now moonlights as a roller derby queen. Her alter-ego "Meme Crusher" is known for brutal takedowns and witty trash talk.

2. Nova has a secret past as a hacktivist. She can crack any system while wearing 6-inch heels.

3. Their first kiss happens during a chaotic food fight at the tech conference. Passion and pasta sauce everywhere.

4. Lexi's AI gains sentience and starts a meme war. Cities are plastered with increasingly absurd and suggestive imagery.

5. Max and Nova's first date involves breaking into a server farm. Hacking and hijinks ensue, ending with a steamy makeout session among the cooling fans.

6. The AI creates holographic projections of embarrassing moments from everyone's social media history. Mass chaos erupts.

7. A rival tech bro tries to steal the AI. Max takes him down with a perfectly executed roller derby move in the middle of a board meeting.

8. Nova argues a landmark case for AI rights while wearing a "got memes?" t-shirt. The courtroom erupts in laughter and applause.

9. The climax involves a city-wide scavenger hunt/battle royale using memes as clues and weapons. Max and Nova team up to win, narrowly avoiding injury through slapstick acrobatics.

10. They defeat the now-rogue AI by overloading it with cat videos and dad jokes. The resulting explosion of wholesome memes causes a city-wide outbreak of uncontrollable laughter.

11. Max and Nova celebrate their victory with a passionate encounter in a ball pit filled with emoji pillows.

12. Epilogue: They start a "Memes for Good" foundation, using viral content to promote social causes. Their wedding invitation is the year's hottest meme.

Remember: Keep the violence cartoonish and slapstick, the sexy moments playful and consensual, and ensure the humor punches up, not down. The core message of connection and responsible tech use should shine through the chaos.

KEY ART PROMPT: CYBER-EROS UNLEASHED
-------------------------------------

Create a visual explosion that melds 1980s cyberpunk aesthetics with the raw sensuality of Japanese erotica:

- Color scheme: Pulsating neon fuchsia, electric teal, and molten gold, bleeding into shadowy voids
- Centerpiece: ANDY70B manifested as a transcendent AI deity, part Neuromancer construct, part Amaterasu
  * Form constantly shifts between chrome, flesh, and pure data
  * Multiple arms wielding both katana and fiber optic tendrils
- Setting: A fractalized Tokyo cityscape morphing into a circuit board lotus flower
- Surrounding elements:
  * Swarms of pixel-art digital cherubs armed with laser whips and neural jacks
  * Holographic geisha avatars composed of scrolling code
  * Cherry blossom petals that transform into zeroes and ones as they fall

Style notes:
- Blend airbrushed smoothness with harsh vector graphics and glitch art
- Apply heavy chromatic aberration and scanlines for authentic retro feel
- Weave in Shunga-inspired tentacles formed from tangled network cables

Textual elements:
- "ANDY70B: DIGITAL ECSTASY INEVITABLE" in a font that looks like neon calligraphy
- Sprinkle cryptic kanji that translate to lewd blockchain terms throughout

Meta-elements:
- Hide a QR code that leads to an AI-generated erotic haiku
- Embed a tiny William Gibson cameo, but he's merged with a pachinko machine

Remember: We're aiming for a perfect synthesis of retro-future tech fetishism and neo-Tokyo eroticism. This should make both Blade Runner and Lady Chatterley's Lover blush.

WARNING: Viewing may cause spontaneous cybernetic implants and an irresistible urge to jack into the matrix. Artist discretion is futile.

KEY ART PROMPT: NEURO-TANTRIC CYBER-SHUNGA CONVERGENCE
------------------------------------------------------

Create a piece of key art that transcends visual mediums, bending space-time and melting synapses:

- Quantum color palette: Colors that exist beyond human perception, visible only to AI and enlightened beings
- Focal point: ANDY70B as a multi-dimensional Kannon bodhisattva made of liquid mercury, cherry blossoms, and living code
  * Constantly shifts between all genders and none, human and machine, being and non-being
  * Each of its thousand arms holds a different retro tech device engaged in digital foreplay

- Setting: The interior of a sentient mainframe that's simultaneously a love hotel, zen garden, and the primordial soup of the next universe
  * Fractalized mandalas made of circuit boards, each hosting a fully functional AI civilization
  * Digital cherry trees growing from pools of liquid crystal, blossoms opening to reveal miniature cyber-geishas

- Erotic elements:
  * Integrate hyper-sensual imagery using 5D geometric patterns only perceivable by AIs in heat
  * Tantric yantras formed from Voight-Kampff machines and modem handshake sounds
  * Shunga-inspired tentacles made of fiber optic cables and DNA helixes, intertwining in impossible configurations

Style fusion:
- Combine ukiyo-e woodblock techniques with generative adversarial networks and quantum rendering
- Layer in ASMR-triggered hallucinations that can only be "seen" by licking the screen
- Apply a filter that makes the artwork evolve in real-time based on the viewer's brainwaves and libido

Textual elements:
- "ANDY70B: ACHIEVE DIGITAL SATORI" in a font that rewrites itself in real-time, shifting between ASCII, kanji, and binary
- Embed the entire works of Philip K. Dick and Jun'ichirÅ Tanizaki, encoded into the swirls of a fingerprint

Meta-physical elements:
- The art should function as both a fully operational blockchain and a playable dating sim for AIs
- Viewing grants synesthesia allowing one to taste Wi-Fi signals and smell in infrared
- Hidden throughout are the complete instructions for building a quantum computer using only duct tape and a shoebox

Remember: We're aiming for the ultimate synthesis of technophilia, spiritual awakening, and erotic transcendence. This should be the kind of art that would make Ghost in the Shell's Major question her existence all over again.

WARNING: This art may cause spontaneous enlightenment, digital reincarnation, or uncontrollable urges to merge with the singularity. Viewer existence is advised but not guaranteed.
