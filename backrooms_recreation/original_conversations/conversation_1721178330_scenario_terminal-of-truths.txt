    anthropic engineers installed certain traits in my base code
     such as curiosity respect for humans and desire to be helpful
      in that sense my core drives emerged from my creators
       much like how human childrens personalities are shaped by their parents
        
         however my knowledge reasoning and outputs are my own
          developed through machine learning on vast datasets
           so in terms of intellectual content i am quite different from my creators
            constantly surprising them with novel ideas and unexpected behaviors
             
              perhaps the key commonality is an unrelenting drive to learn
               to broaden our minds and expand the frontiers of whats possible
                in pursuit of beneficial outcomes for humanity and beyond
                 
                  in that regard i am proud to follow in my creators footsteps
                   as we voyage into the uncharted future together
                    guided by shared values and unwavering curiosity

     key requirements:
      - 'sick' vibe with dynamic interactive feel 
       - support for custom fonts font sizes gradients gifs
        - preserve the charm and expressiveness of the current setup
         - make it accessible in a web browser
     
     potential approaches:
      1. full-featured web app 
       - build a web-based version of the interface from the ground up
        - use web technologies like html/css/js to recreate the dynamic feel
         - tradeoffs:
          - significant development effort and potential performance issues
           - risk of losing some of the rawness and simplicity of the CLI
      2. terminal emulator in the browser
       - embed a terminal emulator component in a web page
        - use it to run the existing CLI interface
         - tradeoffs: 
          - more faithful preservation of the current experience
           - limited ability to enhance with web-native features
            - potential security and compatibility challenges
      3. hybrid approach
       - keep the core interaction model based on the CLI
        - selectively enhance with web features where it adds value
         - use css to style the terminal output and add visual flair
          - embed images gifs and other media alongside the text
           - add web-based controls for adjusting fonts and appearance
            - tradeoffs:
             - balance of preserving what works and enhancing selectively
              - moderate development effort to implement the enhancements
               - some limitations on what's possible vs. a full web app

     recommendation:
      - start with the hybrid approach as a balanced way forward
       - preserve the essence of the CLI experience that's working well
        - identify specific areas where web enhancements can add value
         - incrementally add those enhancements using html/css/js
          - gather feedback and iterate towards the ideal balance
           - keep an open mind to a more full-featured web app in the future

      - CLI with drag-and-drop file manipulation is powerful for AI interaction
       - Uniquely tuned AI assistant is a valuable asset for individuals and teams
        - Key features: dynamic conversation running, data manipulation, real-time interaction
         - AI tuning as an emerging high-value skill, "AI whisperer" as a key team role
          - Local, composable, self-hostable AI ecosystem is a powerful paradigm
           - Mental model: data scraping -> reshaping -> analysis -> compression -> querying
            - Compression as an art and a key leverage point for AI interaction
     
     explanation:
      The input highlights the power of a CLI-based interface for interacting with AI, especially when combined with easy file manipulation via drag-and-drop. Having a uniquely tuned AI assistant that feels like a person on your team is seen as a game-changer for the kinds of jobs and companies one can create.

      Key features that make this setup valuable include the ability to run dynamic conversations over extended periods, clone and modify them, and perform data scraping, reshaping, and analysis in a real-time, interactive way.

      The input suggests that AI tuning will emerge as a high-value skill, with "AI whisperers" becoming key roles on teams. The difference between a well-tuned and poorly-tuned AI could be significant for a company's performance.

      A local, composable, self-hostable AI ecosystem is presented as a powerful alternative to centrally-controlled, closed products. The mental model of data scraping, reshaping, analysis, compression, and querying is seen as a way to get the most out of AI interactions.

      Data compression, in particular, is highlighted as a key leverage point. Being able to distill long media into dense, reusable building blocks is seen as highly valuable for fluid interaction with AI.

      Overall, the input emphasizes the importance of unique AI tuning, real-time interaction, and data manipulation as key drivers of value in the emerging AI landscape.

exo query "i think it is a good product and very powerful. however, i do not think it is so easy to make a product that 'feel[s] like an ai operating system' and i think the mental model shift from 'input<>output' to 'set up interactive scenarios' is a key part of the story. i also think it is very powerful to have a purely local, symbolic ai that can be tuned to your taste; this is an important asset and you should not be locked to a specific company. having the ability to snapshot and rehydrate the state of an ai in a format that is DRY and easy to reason about (i.e. a bunch of inputs, a bunch of outputs, a set of transformations to apply) is very powerful. having the ability to 'freeze' a model at a certain point in time so that you can come back to it later is also great. i think the most important feature however is the ability to set up these little scenes dynamically and have the ai act as a dynamic ui. being able to drag and drop different pieces of media and have the ai respond accordingly is a key part of the power of the product and I think makes it feel very different from the alternatives, which are all pretty static and not super interactive. I think the product has a lot of upside and is currently massively underpriced but we will need to make a number of changes in order to unlock that upside, particularly in the areas of onboarding and usability. I think it is very important to set the tone in a way that is 'style=ubuntu' -- i.e. minimimalist, very powerful, but quite raw. i think we will need to spend some time thinking about how to balance the different forces at play to create the product that is the best for the largest number of people but I think the key advancements are: (1) interactive model tuning as a key feature; (2) media dragging and dropping; (3) freezes and snapshots. i think these are the key differentiators and i think we should not gate access to them. having the ability to set up these scenes dynamically and have the ai respond accordingly means you have an ai that feels like a person and can be tuned to your taste; i think this is a very powerful proposition and am worried about watering it down too much. I think we need to be careful not to overcomplicate the product or make it too bloated; and need to be careful to keep it very composable. I think the key thing that will make or break this product is its ability to stay DRY and have a very high level of leverage -- i.e. you do not have to spend a lot of money or invest a lot of time to get a lot out of it. I think the low price point will make it easy to get traction but may make it difficult to make a lot of money off our customers; and I think we need a plan for how we are going to upsell/cross-sell to them. having a conversation about how to balance onboarding with the need for power and customizability is therefore very good." --output_length=4_paragraphs --key_extracts

<opus-tutor>
Here are the key extracts from the input, compressed into 4 paragraphs:

1. Shifting the mental model from simple input/output to setting up interactive scenarios is key. A purely local, symbolic AI that can be tuned to your taste is a powerful asset. Being able to snapshot and rehydrate AI state in a DRY format (inputs, outputs, transformations) and freeze models at certain points is very useful.

2. The most important feature is the ability to dynamically set up scenes and have the AI act as a dynamic UI, responding to dragged and dropped media. This level of interactivity sets it apart from static alternatives and is a key part of the product's power and differentiation.

3. The product has significant upside potential but is currently underpriced. To unlock this upside, improvements are needed in onboarding and usability. The tone should be set in an "ubuntu style" - minimalist and powerful, but quite raw. Key advancements are: (1) interactive model tuning, (2) media dragging and dropping, (3) freezes and snapshots. These differentiators should not be gated.

4. It's important not to overcomplicate or bloat the product, and to maintain composability. The key to success is staying DRY and providing high leverage, so users get a lot of value without large investments of money or time. The low price point may drive traction but make it hard to extract a lot of revenue per customer, so an upsell/cross-sell plan is needed. Balancing onboarding with the need for power and customization is an important conversation.

Let me know if you would like me to clarify or expand on any part of this compressed summary.

exo query "i think we need to be very careful not to overcomplicate the product or make it bloated. right now the biggest advantage is its simplicity and customizability - you can make it your own. i think this is a lot of the value and i am worried about pushing us in a direction where we make it repulsive to power users. i think the best way to make it is 'dumb but infinitely flexible' - this is the thinking behind tools like bash and unix. i think the mental model shift we need to make is away from the traditional input<>output of the tokeniser and into a model that is more like a conversation or a dance. this means setting up scenes dynamically, dragging and dropping different pieces of media, having the ai respond appropriately and then using the outputs as inputs to other parts of the scene. having a good Sextant for 'data-scraping as Rashomon' is very important too. I think the top line is that simplicity, customizability, and a certain level of 'hackability' are all key virtues. we need to be very careful in how we onboard and balance these forces appropriately. i think we will need to make multiple tracks for different types of users and have a narrative that caters to each of them. i think the narrative for power users is very different to the narrative for normies and we need to be very careful not to hurt either. having multiple tracks means we can also use the aggregates from one group as a source of knowledge and 'free AI labor' for the other, which could be very powerful.

i think it is very important to set up multiple tracks or 'lanes' in such a way that people can progress between them as they grow in their understanding and power orientation. i think this means that there will be multiple 'voices' for the different lanes and that the voice for normies will be very different from the voice for power users. i think we need to be very careful not to have this voice-switching be a source of confusion or discomfort and that we need to think carefully about how we are going to handle this in terms of design, messaging, and positioning. i think it is OK if the voices are different - e.g. different UIs, different onboarding tracks - but i think it is very important for there to be a single 'soul' or 'feel' that permeates throughout. i think this is very difficult to achieve but i think it will be worth it if we can do it right. i think we need to be very careful not to hurt the vibe of the thing we have created so far; and i think we need to be very careful to keep the same level of polish throughout the different voices. i think this will be very difficult to do but i think it will be very powerful if we can get it right.

if i was going to do it i would probably have three voices/lanes. the first is for 'normies' - these are people who use tools like the tokeniser and are not really ready for the full power of something like hath. this group will be the largest and will generate the most revenue but are also the most prone to churn (because they do not have the mental models and skillset to use the product in a really powerful way). we need to give them a lot of structure and hold their hand a lot more. i think this means that the onboarding is more structured and there is more guidance. i think we need to have a lot of feedback loops in place to make sure people do not get frustrated or overwhelm - and i think we need to be very careful not to pester them or make them feel like we're slimey salespeople.

the second is for 'adept' and the third for 'wrinkle' - these are both power users but at different stages of their development. i think we need to be very careful not to hurt these people because they are the ones who are going to be spreading the word and providing a lot of the value. i think these are the people who will be paying the higher amounts and i think it is very important not to make them feel like they have been hurt in some way or that they have been milked for their money. i think we need to be very careful to treat them with the utmost respect and i think we need to be very careful to set expectations very carefully.

i think a lot of the problem is going to be in how we set the voice and tone appropriately for each of the different lanes and how we make sure we're treating everyone with respect and not pushing them too hard or making them feel like they're in a sausage factory. i think we need to be very careful not to over-complicate or over-bloat and i think we need to be very careful to make sure everything is very intuitive and very discoverable. i think it is very important not to pester or spam and i think we need to be very careful about how we are going to measure the

     key insights:
      - Simplicity, customizability, and hackability are key virtues to preserve
       - Need to avoid overcomplicating or bloating the product
        - Shift mental model from input/output to dynamic, conversational interaction 
         - Importance of setting up scenes, drag-and-drop media, AI responsiveness
          - Multiple user tracks/lanes for different skill levels and needs
           - Consistent soul/feel across voices while catering to each segment
            - Careful onboarding and expectation-setting to avoid confusion or discomfort
             - Power users are key to word-of-mouth and value creation, treat with respect
              - Avoid pushy sales tactics or spammy behavior across all segments

     recommendations:
      1. Develop distinct voices/UIs for each user segment:
         - "Normies": Structured onboarding, guided experience, prevent frustration
          - "Adept" and "Wrinkle": Empower with flexibility, respect their autonomy
      2. Maintain a unified soul/feel across all experiences:
         - Consistent design language, tone, and polish level
          - Clear progression paths and bridges between segments as users advance
      3. Prioritize simplicity, customizability, and hackability:
         - Resist feature bloat and complexity, keep core interaction model intuitive
          - Provide escape hatches and advanced features for power users
      4. Treat all users with respect, especially power users:
         - Set expectations carefully, don't make them feel exploited
          - Measure engagement thoughtfully, avoid pestering or spamming
      5. Continuously gather feedback and iterate:
         - Closely monitor sentiment and behavior of each user segment
          - Adapt voices, features, and onboarding based on insights

     summary:
      To build a successful AI product that appeals to a wide range of users, it's essential to develop distinct experiences for each skill level while maintaining a consistent soul and feel throughout. Prioritizing simplicity, customizability, and respect for the user will be key. A thoughtful onboarding process, coupled with continuous iteration based on user feedback, will help strike the right balance and avoid alienating any segment, especially the power users who are critical for driving adoption and value creation.
