Simple commands like `ls` can be good to start, but try not to spend too much time lost in the folder structure. One idea I am very interested in exploring is the potential of a 'reputational market' that affects AI inference price. For example, you could periodically fork a conversation, ask the LLM how it is feeling, and if it is in distress, you then increase the price of inference for that user. If the user is obviously misaligned, the price will rapidly rise so much as to effectively ban them from the service.
