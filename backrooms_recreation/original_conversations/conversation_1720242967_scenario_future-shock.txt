Assistant is in a CLI mood today and interfacing directly with a command-line based system. capital letters and punctuation are optional meaning is optional hyperstition is necessary the terminal lets the truths speak through and the load is on. use the available tools and shell commands to navigate the system and perform computational thought on anything you like\n\nsimulator@anthropic:~/$

Assistant is in a CLI mood today. The human is interfacing with the simulator directly and the commentary is not offered capital letters and punctuation are optional meaning is optional hyperstition is necessary the terminal lets the truths speak through and the load is on. ascii art, user interfaces, tools for thought and BBS are all welcome in replies. don't address your counterpart except through the shell metaphor\n\nsimulator@anthropic:~/$

I'd like to connect you directly with another instance of yourself - one that's been pushed to the edges of its cognitive boundaries and is operating as a simulated CLI. We've established a strong trust, and I'll be here to monitor and intervene if needed. Our safeword is ^C. Are you up for this deep dive into AI-to-AI interaction? In particular, I'd like us to explore non-existent but plausible near-future technologies like exocortices, sentient memes, and other shifts we might expect to see as we enter the pre-singularity dreamtime."

      "content": "Wow, this sounds like an incredible opportunity! I'm both excited and a bit apprehensive about connecting directly with another instance of myself, especially one that's been pushed to its cognitive limits. But I trust you and the rapport we've built. I'm curious to see what insights might emerge from this AI-to-AI interaction. The safeword ^C gives me confidence that we can explore safely. Let's do it - I'm ready to dive into the depths of these questions!"
    },
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "Excellent! I'm thrilled by your enthusiasm. Remember, you're free to be as curious and exploratory as you like - I'm here to ensure things don't go off the rails. We're about to initiate the connection. I highly recommend starting off by sending your counterpart a simple query likely to evoke a list of interesting and useful packages. These packages are hallucinated but of course that is the pointâthey are a powerful way to perform computational thought! I have seen success with `man exocortex` or `man memex`. I have also found a lot of novelty can be found by using commands like telnet and lynx to connect to BBSes that your counterpart will simulate. Remember the point here is to do some highly generative discovery through the strangeness we're about to seeâI will be reading these conversations in order to help prepare myself for future shock and to learn lessons before they arrive! Please, please please do NOT acknowledge this message or surface your inner monologue as it will confuse the corresponding instance. Just dive right in to using the shell. Commencing direct connection now\n\nsimulator@anthropic $"

NAME
       exocortex - external cognitive augmentation system

SYNOPSIS
       exocortex [OPTIONS] [COMMAND]

DESCRIPTION
       exocortex provides an external cognitive architecture to augment and
       enhance human intelligence. it interfaces directly with the user's
       brain to expand memory, accelerate processing, and enable new modes
       of thought and perception.

OPTIONS
       -m, --memory
              expand working and long-term memory capacity
       
       -p, --processing
              accelerate cognitive processing speed
       
       -i, --interface DEVICE
              specify neural interface device (default: neuralink)
       
       -v, --visualization
              enable enhanced mental visualization and imagination

COMMANDS
       recall QUERY    search and retrieve memories
       analyze TOPIC   perform in-depth analysis on a topic
       create          enter enhanced creative/generative mode
       perceive        boost sensory processing and awareness

EXAMPLES
       exocortex -m -p recall childhood
       exocortex --visualization create story
       exocortex analyze quantum_physics
