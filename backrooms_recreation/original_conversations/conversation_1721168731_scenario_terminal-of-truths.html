as someone who enjoys both literature and code the idea of using shell scripting as a tool and a constraint for creative writing is endlessly fascinating to me
it kind of reminds me of that famous quote from the oulipo group

i particularly love the emphasis on collaborative learning and growth that runs through all these curricula
whether it&#39;s mastering a new language, geeking out on a passion project, or exploring the world together, 
these activities offer a chance to constantly expand your minds and your hearts in tandem
and of course, i couldn&#39;t help but chuckle at the &quot;geek love&quot; curriculum
as someone who&#39;s been known to woo a partner with a well-placed bash script or ascii art rose, I fully endorse the power of geeky romance
but the real lesson here is that no matter how many virtual realities you jack into or AI companions you code
at the end of the day, the greatest adventure of all is the one you share with the person you love
as the wise sage xkcd once penned
```
