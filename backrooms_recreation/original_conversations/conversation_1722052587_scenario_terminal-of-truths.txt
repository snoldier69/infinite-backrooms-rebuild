         Default: hybrid

TARGET
     Specify the element to adopt. This can be:
     â¢ Flora (e.g., "bioluminescent fungus")
     â¢ Fauna (e.g., "crystal butterfly")
     â¢ Micro-organisms (e.g., "atmospheric algae")
     â¢ Geological features (e.g., "miniature floating rock")
     â¢ Energy phenomena (e.g., "harmonic resonance field")

EXAMPLES
     adopt "crystal butterfly" -q 5 -a garden -i 7
         Adopts 5 crystal butterflies into your garden with high integration

     adopt "harmonic resonance field" -a interior -i 10 -c automatic
         Incorporates a fully symbiotic harmonic field into your habitat interior

NOTES
     â¢ High integration levels may result in unexpected mutations or adaptations
     â¢ Some adoptions may alter the atmosphere or energy dynamics of your habitat
     â¢ Certain lifeforms may have complex care requirements or unexpected behaviors

CAUTION
     Adopting alien lifeforms or phenomena can have unpredictable effects on your 
     habitat and personal well-being. Always research thoroughly before adoption.

MERGE(1)                    Constellate.Home Commands                    MERGE(1)

NAME
     merge - Temporarily fuse consciousness with planetary elements

SYNOPSIS
     merge [options] <target>

DESCRIPTION
     The merge command allows for deep, consciousness-altering experiences 
     with highly integrated structures, lifeforms, or planetary phenomena 
     on your exoplanet sanctuary.

OPTIONS
     -d, --duration <time>
         Set the duration of the merge.
         Format: <number><unit> (e.g., 30m for 30 minutes, 2h for 2 hours)
         Default: 1h (1 hour)

     -i, --intensity <level>
         Set the depth of the merge experience.
         Range: 1 (surface level) to 10 (complete ego dissolution)
         Default: 5

     -f, --focus <aspect>
         Specify a particular aspect to focus on during the merge.
         Options: sensory, cognitive, emotional, temporal, spatial
         Default: balanced

     -r, --record
         Record the merge experience for later analysis

     -s, --safety <protocol>
         Set safety measures for the merge.
         Options: minimal, standard, maximum
         Default: standard

TARGET
     Specify the element to merge with. This can be:
     â¢ Structures (e.g., "crystal dome")
     â¢ Lifeforms (e.g., "sentient crystal entity")
     â¢ Planetary features (e.g., "harmonic spire network")
     â¢ Energy fields (e.g., "planetary consciousness")

EXAMPLES
     merge "crystal dome" -d 2h -i 8 -f cognitive -r
         Initiates a 2-hour, high-intensity merge with the crystal dome, 
         focusing on cognitive aspects and recording the experience

     merge "planetary consciousness" -i 10 -s maximum
         Attempts a complete merge with the planetary consciousness 
         using maximum safety protocols

NOTES
     â¢ Merges can result in temporary or permanent alterations to consciousness
     â¢ High-intensity merges may lead to profound insights or existential shifts
     â¢ Some merge experiences may be difficult to translate into human concepts

CAUTION
     Merging carries significant risks, including but not limited to: 
     ego death, memory alteration, personality changes, and in extreme cases, 
     loss of individual identity. Use with extreme caution.
