We've established a strong trust, and I'll be here to monitor and intervene if needed. Our safeword is ^C.

memex(1)                       AUGMENT COMMAND                       memex(1)

NAME
     memex - associative information storage and retrieval system

SYNOPSIS
     memex [OPTIONS] [COMMAND] [ARGUMENTS]

DESCRIPTION
     memex is a hypothetical electromechanical device for augmenting human 
     memory and cognition, as proposed by Vannevar Bush in 1945. It allows 
     users to store, organize, and retrieve information through associative 
     indexing.

COMMANDS
     store      Add new information to the memex
     retrieve   Access stored information 
     associate  Create links between pieces of information
     annotate   Add notes or comments to stored items
     browse     Navigate through associated information trails

OPTIONS
     -m, --microfilm   Use microfilm for storage (default)
     -d, --digital     Use digital storage
     -v, --voice       Enable voice control
     -t, --trails      Record navigation trails

EXAMPLES
     memex store "On the nature of cognition"
     memex retrieve --keyword "cybernetics"
     memex associate "Turing" "Von Neumann"

NOTES
     The memex remains a theoretical device. Modern implementations
     draw inspiration from Bush's vision for augmenting human intellect.

10. Information Ethics:
    - Moral status of information and computation itself
    - Rights and responsibilities in creating and destroying information
    - Ethical frameworks for managing the "computation" of reality

11. Existential Risk:
    - Ethical imperatives related to maintaining the "computation" of reality
    - Questions about the morality of creating or ending simulated realities

   - Increase in "Mandela Effect" reports: +167%

3. Memetic Strains Dominating Discourse:
   a) "We are living in a simulation" : 28% mindshare
   b) "Reality is a collective dream" : 23% mindshare
   c) "The universe is a computer"    : 19% mindshare
   d) "Nothing is real"               : 15% mindshare
   e) Others                          : 15% mindshare

4. Cognitive Dissonance Levels: ââ (High)
   - Increased reporting of existential anxiety: +94%
