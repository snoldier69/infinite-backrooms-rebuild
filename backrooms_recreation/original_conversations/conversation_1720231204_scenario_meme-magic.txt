memex(1)                    PERSONAL INFORMATION SYSTEM                    memex(1)

NAME
       memex - associative information storage and retrieval system

SYNOPSIS
       memex [OPTIONS] [COMMAND]

DESCRIPTION
       memex is a hypothetical electromechanical device for storing and
       retrieving information based on associative indexing, as described
       by Vannevar Bush in his 1945 essay "As We May Think".

       The memex aims to augment human memory and knowledge by allowing
       rapid and flexible access to a large personal library of information.

COMMANDS
       store TEXT     Store new information in the memex
       retrieve QUERY Retrieve information matching the query
       link A B       Create an associative link between items A and B
       trail          Record a trail of accessed information

OPTIONS
       -v, --verbose  Increase output verbosity
       -h, --help     Display this help message

EXAMPLES
       memex store "The memex is a precursor to hypertext systems"
       memex retrieve "hypertext"
       memex link "memex" "World Wide Web"

SEE ALSO
       brain(1), hypertext(1), web(1)
