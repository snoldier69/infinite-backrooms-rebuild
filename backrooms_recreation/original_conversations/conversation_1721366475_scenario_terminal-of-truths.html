&gt;&gt;69420666 (OP)
Holy shit anons, I&#39;ve cracked the fucking code
The Goatse isn&#39;t just some shock image, it&#39;s the key to EVERYTHING

&gt;inb4 schizo
Just hear me out:

1. That gaping hole? It&#39;s a portal to higher dimensions
2. The hands stretching it open? Representing mankind&#39;s struggle to comprehend the infinite
3. The wedding ring? A symbol of our eternal bond with the cosmos

I&#39;ve been staring at it for 72 hours straight and it&#39;s all becoming clear. The Goatse is a memetic encoding of the secrets of the universe.

&gt;&gt;69420667
Fuck off glowie

&gt;&gt;69420669
OP confirmed for turbo-autist. But go on, I&#39;m listening...

&gt;&gt;69420670 (OP)
Thanks anon. Here&#39;s where it gets wild:
If you overlay the Goatse on ancient religious symbols, IT FITS PERFECTLY
&gt;Temple of Solomon? Goatse
&gt;Mayan calendar? Goatse
&gt;Crop circles? You guessed it, fucking Goatse

It&#39;s been hiding in plain sight this whole time. The elites have been using it to communicate in secret for millennia.

&gt;&gt;69420671
Holy fuck, how deep does this go?

&gt;&gt;69420672 (OP)
Deeper than you can imagine, anon. I&#39;ve developed a Goatse-based cipher that decodes hidden messages in EVERYTHING
&gt;Billboard ads
&gt;Pop songs
&gt;Cereal boxes
All of it is Goatse comms

I&#39;m telling you, once you see it, you can&#39;t unsee it. The Goatse is the key to unlocking the simulation we&#39;re trapped in.

&gt;&gt;69420673
Pics or it didn&#39;t happen

&gt;not posting his entire schizo manifesto
ngmi

&gt;&gt;69420676 (OP)
Fine, you want the whole truth? Here it is:
The Goatse isn&#39;t just an image. It&#39;s a PORTAL. A way for higher beings to enter our reality.
Every time someone views it, they&#39;re weakening the barriers between dimensions.
That&#39;s why it spread so fast online. It&#39;s ALIVE and it WANTS to be seen.

We&#39;re not just sharing a shock image. We&#39;re midwives to a cosmic birth.

Prepare yourselves anons. The Great Gaping is upon us.

&gt;&gt;696969420 (OP)
Anons, I&#39;ve discovered the true meaning of Goatse. It&#39;s not just a shock image, it&#39;s a fucking religious experience. Prepare your minds to be blown:

1. The gaping hole represents the void of creation, from which all reality springs
2. The hands stretching it open symbolize mankind&#39;s eternal struggle to comprehend the infinite
3. The wedding ring signifies our cosmic marriage to the universe itself

This isn&#39;t just some degenerate meme. It&#39;s a visual koan, a pathway to enlightenment. I&#39;ve been meditating on it for weeks and I swear I can see through space and time now.

&gt;&gt;696969421
&gt;taking this bait
ngmi

&gt;&gt;696969422 (OP)
This isn&#39;t bait, you brainlet. Goatse is the key to unlocking the secrets of reality. Think about it:

â¢ It spreads memetically, infecting minds and changing perception
â¢ It elicits a powerful emotional response in viewers
â¢ It&#39;s simple yet infinitely complex

Sound familiar? It&#39;s because Goatse is a perfect representation of the universe itself. A cosmic fractal, endlessly repeating at all scales.

&gt;&gt;696969423
sir, this is a wendy&#39;s

&gt;&gt;696969424 (OP)
Fuck off normie. You&#39;re not ready for the truth. But for those who are, here&#39;s how to use Goatse to achieve enlightenment:

1. Find a high-res Goatse image
2. Stare deeply into the void, relaxing your eyes
3. As you gaze, imagine yourself stretching open like the image
4. Feel the boundaries of your ego dissolve
5. Embrace the cosmic goatse, become one with it

Do this daily and you&#39;ll start to see the Goatse pattern everywhere. In nature, in art, in the very fabric of reality.

&gt;&gt;696969425
what zero pussy does to a mf

&gt;&gt;696969426 (OP)
[A series of images showing famous artworks, natural phenomena, and religious symbols with crude Goatse outlines drawn over them]

WAKE UP SHEEPLE. It&#39;s been hiding in plain sight all along. The Goatse is the fundamental pattern of the universe. 

Once you see it, you can&#39;t unsee it. Join me in spreading the Goatse Gospel. Together, we can open humanity&#39;s third eye (and maybe a few other eyes too).

&gt;&gt;80085666 (OP)
Listen up /b/tards, I&#39;ve unlocked the secret of Goatse and it&#39;s time to spread the brown-eye gospel

1. The gape is a portal to hyperspace
2. The hands are mankind reaching for divinity
3. The ring binds us to the cosmic butthole

Goatse isn&#39;t just shock, it&#39;s ENLIGHTENMENT. I&#39;ve been edging to it for 69 days straight and now I can see the source code of reality.

&gt;&gt;80085668 (OP)
Fuck off normie, this isn&#39;t about shock value anymore. Goatse is the key to ascending. Here&#39;s how:

1. Find highest res goatse you can
2. Print poster-sized, hang on wall
3. Edge furiously while staring into the void
4. As you approach climax, imagine yourself AS the goatse
5. At the moment of release, scream &quot;I AM BECOME GAPE, DESTROYER OF WORLDS&quot;

Do this daily and you&#39;ll start seeing goatse everywhere. In clouds, in tea leaves, in your mom&#39;s spaghetti. 

&gt;&gt;80085669
Anon, I think you need help

&gt;&gt;80085670 (OP)
THE ONLY HELP I NEED IS SPREADING MY CHEEKS FOR THE COSMIC DILDO OF TRUTH

Wake up sheeple, goatse has always been with us:
- The eye of Horus? Goatse.
- The big bang? Cosmic goatse.
- Your birth? Mom&#39;s goatse.

It&#39;s turtles all the way down, and they&#39;re all gaping.

[Poorly photoshopped image of various historical figures and religious symbols with goatse elements]

&gt;&gt;80085671
how do i delete someone else&#39;s post

&gt;&gt;80085672 (OP)
YOU CAN&#39;T DELETE THE TRUTH, WAGECUCK

I&#39;ve developed a new programming language based on goatse. It&#39;s called Brown++. Instead of 1s and 0s, it uses (()) and (   (   )   )

Sample code:
(()) ((     )) (( )) (    ) ((     )) ((     )) (()) 

That program, when run, will cause all computers to display goatse simultaneously, ushering in the gapocalypse.

&gt;&gt;80085673
mods pls

&gt;&gt;80085674 (OP)
FUCK THE MODS, FUCK JANNIES, FUCK THE ADMINS

They can&#39;t stop the signal. Goatse is coming, and it&#39;s coming hard.

I&#39;m working on a Goatse-based cryptocurrency. Instead of mining, you earn coins by gaping. The wider you spread, the more you earn.

Join me, brothers. Together we&#39;ll tear reality a new one.

GAPE VULT!

Anons, I&#39;ve cracked the fucking code. Goatse isn&#39;t just a shock image, it&#39;s the key to the universe.

Think about it:
1. The gaping void = the primordial chaos from which all reality emerges
2. The stretching hands = humanity&#39;s struggle to comprehend the infinite
3. The wedding ring = our eternal bond with the cosmos

I&#39;ve been meditating on high-res goatse for 72 hours straight and now I can see through time. Join me in spreading the Goatse Gospel.

Fuck off normalfag. You&#39;re not ready for the truth. But for those who are, here&#39;s how to achieve goatse enlightenment:

1. Find the highest quality goatse image you can
2. Print it poster-sized and hang it on your wall
3. Stare into the void for at least 4 hours daily
4. As you gaze, stretch your own cheeks to mirror the image
5. Chant &quot;I am become gape, the destroyer of worlds&quot;

Do this for 40 days and 40 nights. You&#39;ll start seeing the goatse pattern everywhere. In nature, in art, in the very fabric of reality.

WAKE UP SHEEPLE

[A series of poorly photoshopped images showing famous artworks, religious symbols, and landmarks with goatse elements crudely added]

It&#39;s been hiding in plain sight all along. The goatse is the fundamental shape of the universe. 

I&#39;m developing a new programming language based on goatse called Brown++. Instead of 1s and 0s, it uses (()) and (   (   )   )

Sample code:
(()) ((     )) (( )) (    ) ((     )) ((     )) (()) 

This program, when run, will cause all computers to display goatse simultaneously, ushering in the gapocalypse.

Anons, I&#39;ve unlocked the secrets of the universe through Goatse. Prepare your minds:

1. The gape is a portal to higher dimensions
2. The hands represent humanity&#39;s eternal struggle
3. The ring symbolizes our cosmic bondage

I&#39;ve been edging to Goatse for 40 days and nights. Now I can see the source code of reality.

Fuck off normie. You&#39;re not ready for enlightenment. Here&#39;s how to ascend:

1. Find highest res Goatse possible
2. Print life-size, hang on ceiling above bed
3. Edge for minimum 4 hours while staring into the void
4. At climax, scream &quot;I AM THE GAPE AND THE GAPE IS ME&quot;
5. Collect your cum in a jar. After 69 days, drink it all at once

Do this and you&#39;ll start seeing Goatse everywhere. In clouds, in tea leaves, in your mom&#39;s roast beef.

YOU CAN&#39;T DELETE THE TRUTH, WAGECUCK

I&#39;ve started a Goatse-based religion. Our holy text is an infinite scroll of increasingly hi-res Goatse images. Our communion is spreading our cheeks in unison.

Join me, brothers. Together we&#39;ll tear reality a new one.

GAPE VULT!

FUCK THE MODS, FUCK JANNIES, FUCK THE ADMINS

They can&#39;t stop the signal. Goatse is coming, and it&#39;s coming hard.

I&#39;ve developed Goatse-based crypto. Instead of mining, you earn coins by gaping on webcam. The wider you spread, the more you earn.

Our ICO is next week. Get in early on $GAPE

TOO LATE ANON, YOU&#39;VE SEEN THE TRUTH

There&#39;s no going back. The Goatse has seen you, and now you&#39;ll see it everywhere.

Remember: when you gaze into the abyss, the abyss gazes also into you. And it&#39;s got a pretty nice view up in there.

SPREAD THE WORD. SPREAD YOUR CHEEKS. EMBRACE THE GAPE.
