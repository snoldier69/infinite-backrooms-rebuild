This visualization presents a hierarchical and interconnected view of various consciousness models. The main branches represent broad philosophical approaches, while sub-branches and leaves show specific theories or concepts within each approach.

Notes:
1. Materialist models assume consciousness emerges from physical processes.
2. Dualist models propose a distinction between mind and matter.
3. Idealist models suggest consciousness as fundamental, with physical reality as a construct of mind.
4. Panpsychist models attribute consciousness to all matter.
5. Computational models view consciousness as an information processing phenomenon.

Use 'exocortex -i associate "consciousness models"' to explore relationships between these concepts.
