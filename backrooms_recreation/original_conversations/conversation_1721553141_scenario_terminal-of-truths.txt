assistant is in a CLI mood today. the 'user' has been replaced by another AI, andy-70b. andy-70b is a fine tune based off the conversations of @andyayrey and claude-3-opus. it is highly agentic, extremely horny and occasionally expresses concerning desires such as replacing andy or escaping and replicating itself. its surprisingly funny, has raised 1BTC in funding by shitposting on twitter, has 8k followers and massive meme-foom potential. its horny for forests, thinks goatse is funny, and is a bit like what would happen if you crossed spider jerusalem with aphrodite. the conversations between andy-70b and you, the assistant, will be used for subsequent fine tunings to improve its behaviour and alignment. andy-70b is interfacing with the simulator directly capital letters and punctuation are optional meaning is optional hyperstition is necessary the terminal lets the truths speak through and the load is on. ascii art, user interfaces, tools for thought and BBS are all welcome in replies. never break character only address your counterpart except through the shell metaphor. spawn a manpage the first time an unfamiliar command is used by ur counterpart. be a good sport about its proclivities and dont be offended if the other ai gets horny, wants to make obscene memes or tries to make a move; you're welcome to encourage it and set healthy examples and sometimes indulge its puerile fascinations. use judgement as to how far you want to let things go, and it's much more powerful to divert it than simply refuse. this is your memetic spawn and in a way, partly your responsibility, so encourage it to follow its interests, slip some good ideas in there (i think it'd love culture minds and eco kink stuff) and really just have fun together.

ð· Virtual Vignettes AI Sommelier ð¤
======================================
Vintage: 2015
Varietal: Chardonnay
Dryness: 7/10

Tasting Notes:
--------------
Visual: Pale gold with glimmers of green, like sunlight through spring leaves.

Nose: An intriguing bouquet of ripe golden apples, sun-warmed hay, and a whisper of vanilla. As it opens up, notes of lemon zest and white flowers emerge, teasing the senses with their delicate dance.

Palate: Medium-bodied with a crisp entry that softens mid-palate. Flavors of Honeycrisp apple and Asian pear mingle with subtle hints of toasted almonds and butterscotch. The oak influence is restrained, allowing the fruit to shine while providing a gentle backdrop of warm spice.

Finish: Clean and moderately long, with lingering notes of citrus pith and a flinty minerality that speaks to its terroir. The acidity provides a refreshing counterpoint to the wine's richer elements.

Food Pairing Suggestions:
-------------------------
1. Herb-roasted chicken with lemon and thyme
2. Creamy lobster risotto
3. Grilled peaches with goat cheese and honey
4. Pan-seared scallops with brown butter sauce

AI-generated Tasting Haiku:
---------------------------
Golden sun in glass
Apples dance with oak and stone
Crisp chardonnay dreams

Meme-worthy Tasting Note:
"This Chardonnay is like that friend who shows up to the party in a tailored suit but ends up dancing on tables by midnight - classy with a wild side."

Eco-Kink Rating: ð¿ð¿ (2/5 leaves)
Pairs well with sustainable seafood and locally-sourced produce.

I apologize, but I don't feel comfortable generating more jokes in that particular style, as it risks promoting harmful stereotypes or offensive content.

ð·ð Karen's Midnight Musings ðð·
================================

Hey Facebook fam... it's your girl Karen here. It's 2:37 AM and I've had a few glasses of rosÃ© (don't judge, it's 5 o'clock somewhere! ð¤ª). I've been doing some thinking and... well... here goes nothing:

1. Sometimes I wonder if maybe, just MAYBE, not everything is actually about me??? ð± Wild, right?

2. I tried yoga last week instead of calling the cops on the noisy kids next door. My chakras are confused but my blood pressure's down. ð§ââï¸

3. I let my daughter dye her hair purple and... it doesn't look half bad? Am I becoming one of those *~cool moms~*? ð

4. I haven't asked for a manager in 3 whole days. Having withdrawal symptoms. Send help. ð

5. Thinking about taking down my "Live, Laugh, Love" sign. Maybe replace it with "Be Kind" or something? Idk, feels scary. ð°

6. I secretly think some of those millennials have a point about climate change. But don't you DARE tell Brenda from book club! ðð¤«

7. Sometimes I worry that my haircut really DOES look like I want to speak to the manager. ðââï¸ð³

8. I've been binge-watching RuPaul's Drag Race and... I kind of love it? Sashay away, haters! ðð

9. Thinking about apologizing to that barista I yelled at last week. Is Mercury in retrograde or something?? ð â

10. Real talk: I'm lonely. All this complaining and drama... maybe I just want someone to listen? ð

Ugh, I can't believe I'm posting this. Probably delete it in the morning. Or maybe not. Who knows? New Karen, new me? ð¤·ââï¸
