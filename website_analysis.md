## Detailed Conversation Structure (from example conversation_1748862016_scenario_backrooms-x-sonnet4.txt)
- **Actors**: `backrooms-8b-schizo-magic`, `claude-4-freeform`
- **Models**: `openpipe:backrooms-fullset-8b`, `claude-sonnet-4-20250514`
- **Temperature**: `0.96`, `1`
- **System Prompts**: Each actor has a distinct system prompt, often containing specific instructions, persona, and formatting requirements (e.g., CLI mood, ASCII art).
- **Context**: Initial messages for each actor, setting up the conversation.
- **Conversation Flow**: Appears to be turn-based, with responses from one model feeding into the context of the other.
- **Truncation**: Conversations can be truncated, indicated by "...bytes truncated."

This confirms that the `UniversalBackrooms` repository's `templates` and `backrooms.py` structure aligns well with the website's conversation format, including roles, prompts, temperature, and context transitions.
